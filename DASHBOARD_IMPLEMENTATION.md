## 📊 User Data Flow

2. **Login**: User logs in → Backend validates → User object stored in localStorage → Redirect to dashboard
3. **Dashboard**: Reads user data from localStorage → Displays personalized content → Shows program and year level
4. **Logout**: Clear localStorage → Redirect to login

## 🔒 Security
- All dashboard routes protected with ProtectedRoute component
- Authentication check on every protected page load
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- User data persists in localStorage for session management
