feat(notes): refactor noteService, secure profile notes, remove stale localStorage

- Add `buildHeaders()` and `handleResponse()` helpers to `frontend/src/services/noteService.js`
- Standardize note API usage to `http://localhost:8080/api/notes` and require `userId` for protected operations
- Normalize and centralize error handling across noteService methods (create/update/delete/archive/save/etc.)
- Fix duplicate/legacy code in `noteService.js` and remove inconsistent implementations
- Update `useNotes` in `frontend/src/services/ProfileLogic.js` to mirror `useSessions`:
  - early return and `[]` when no authenticated user
  - remove global localStorage merge that caused ghost notes when unauthenticated
  - simplify note action handlers and refresh logic for restore/archive
- Fix imports in pages to use `../hooks/useNotesHooks` (moved hooks)
- Minor lint and cleanup fixes (unused catch vars, duplicate functions)
- Verified frontend build: `npm run build` completed successfully

Notes:
- Backend endpoints in `NoteController` are used as-is (user-specific: `/api/notes/user/{userId}/active`, public: `/api/notes/all/active`, etc.).
