## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
  * **Node.js & npm/yarn** (for React frontend)
  * **MySQL Server**
  * **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/markstatic12/AcadeMeet.git
    cd academeet
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**

      * Create a MySQL database named `academeet_db`.
      * Update the database connection details in the backend configuration file:
          * Location: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`)
          * Adjust the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties.

3.  **Backend Setup & Run:**

      * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
      * Build the project using Maven/Gradle (e.g., using a wrapper):
        ```bash
        ./mvnw clean install # If using Maven
        ```
      * Run the Spring Boot application:
        ```bash
        java -jar target/academeet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar # Adjust the file name as needed
        # OR run from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code)
        ```
      * The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

4.  **Frontend Setup & Run:**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend # Assuming 'frontend' is next to 'backend'
        ```
      * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # OR
        yarn install
        ```
      * Start the React development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # OR
        yarn start
        ```
      * The frontend will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
